Project: small Library management system.

1. Here book category model will hold types of books.
2. Another model will hold information about books.
3. Now whenever a registered user tries to issue a book, if the book is not available or already issued to some other user; his entry will be created into some waiting model.
4. The waiting model will tell which user to allocate the book first when it is returned into the library.
5. Users can view the status of the book request done by him/her. But only the book which he/she has requested not all.
6. Also whenever a book is issued an email should be sent to the user with all the details of issued book.

Also take a basic UI theme and integrate it with or some simple basic HTML CSS will also work.
